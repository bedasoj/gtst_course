# Introduction to Python Programming

### What is Python?

**Python** is a popular programming language.

    ● It is a High level & interpreted programming
    language. => Very easy to learn.

    ● It is Very SImplified language any one can 
     write with it, also can read it.

It is used for:
    ●  web development (server-side),
    ●  software development,
    ●  mathematics,
    ●  system scripting.

### Uses of Python
    ● Data visualization
    ● Data analysis
    ● Machine learning
    ● Artificial intelligence
    ● Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)
    ● Game development
    ● Hacking Script writing

### IDE & Code editors

● IDE ( Integrated Development Enviroment ): Is a
Software that helps to write & run a Specific Programming language.

      Example: PythonIDE

● Code Editors: are softwares those can help to write any kind of programming languages. And also by adding some compiling/ interpreting feature they can run programs/scripts.

  Example: Sublime,Vscode

### Python Comments
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

**Creating a Comment**
Comments starts with a **#**, and Python will ignore them:

Example
>**#This is a comment**
        print("Hello, World!")

### Multi Line Comments

Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

Example
>#This is a comment
    #written in
    #more than just one line
    print("Hello, World!")


Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

Example
>""" 
    This is a comment
    written in
    more than just one line
    """
    print("Hello, World!")


### Variables
    ● Variables are a value holders /containers/
    ● They store data
    ● We give some value to some word.
    ● example : number = 10 => from now on my python program knows the value of number is 10.
    ● The process of giving value to word is called Variable Declaration
    ● The word that holds the data is called Identifier
    ● We can Print value of variables by giving the identifier

 ## Python Data Types
### Built-in Data Types

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

**Text Type:	str

Numeric Types:	int, float, complex

Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range

Mapping Type:	dict

Set Types:	set, frozenset

Boolean Type:	bool

Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

None Type:	NoneType**
