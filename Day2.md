**● FAST**

**● Most used**

**● Most hacking tools**

There are so many Distros like:

● Debian

        ○ Kali linux
        ○ Ubuntu
        ○ Parrot
● Arch

        ○ Black arch
        ○ Garuda
● Fedora

● Red Hat

● Gentoo

● Android

## Which OS is best for hackers?
## **1. Kali linux**

 ## Do windows have distros?
● Windows is not open-source so 
peoples won’t use / edit it, so there 
won’t be other kind.

● It just give updates and adds some 
feature on it.

**So… How can we use it?**

A) Main OS/ Main-boot

B) DualBoot / 2in1

C) Live boot

D) Cloud terminals

E) Virtual Machine


*● Computers* have a Technology called 
**“VIRTUALIZATION”.**
This is the 
method how it allocate our using 
memory to the virtual machines/ VM’s 

● This is a method to use windows and 
linux together.

● Softwares that gives you This ability:

        ○ HyberV
        ○ QEMU
        ○ Virtual Box - Oracle
        ○ VMware
        ○ …

F) WSL v2 / Windows Subsystem for Linux

G) Termux - Android
