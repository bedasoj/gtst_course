##:one: Linux File Hierarchy 
    ‚óè Linux/UNIX have a special
       file system than windows.
    ‚óè File system is a directory
         structure that the OS uses.
    ‚óè Windows: System files appear under the
       local disk C:
    ‚óè Linux: System files appear under the root
       directory ( / )

**File structure in detail**
   > **ü•á)  / ( root )**
   ‚û°Ô∏èEvery single file and
    directory starts from the
    **root directory**
    ‚û°Ô∏èThe only **root user** has the
    right to write under this
    directory
   ‚û°Ô∏è **/** root is the root user‚Äôs home
    directory, which is not the
    same as **/**

**:two:bin - Binary executables**
>‚û°Ô∏è Essential command binaries
that need to be available in
single-user mode; for all
users
 **i) e.g) cat, ls, cp,pwd**    

**:three: /boot - Boot loader files**
**üå≥ Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub**
files are located under /boot
:black_circle: **Example:**
initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic,
vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic

 :four:   **/dev - Essential Device files**

üü•These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
**üï∂Ô∏èExample:** /dev/tty1,
/dev/usbmon0

:five: **/etc - et cetera**
>üî∂ Contains configuration files
    required by all programs.
üî∂ This also contains startup and
    shutdown shell scripts used to
    start/stop individual programs.
**üóØÔ∏è  Example:** /etc/resolv.conf,

**:six:  /home - Home directory**

üî∂Home directories for all users to store their personal files.

üóØÔ∏èexample:** /home/nathan,
/home/rexder **

**:seven:/lib - Libraries essential for the
binaries in /bin & /sbin**

üî∂Library filenames are either ld*
or lib*.so.*
üóØÔ∏è Example: $$
ld-2.11.1.so,
libncurses.so.5.7
$$

**:eight: /media - Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs**
üî∂ Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
üóØÔ∏èExamples, /media/cdrom for
CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives;
  **/media/cdrecorder for CD writer**
  **:nine: /mnt - Temporarily mounted file**
üå†Temporary *mount* directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems

üîü **/opt - Optional application
software packages**
üå†Contains add-on applications
from individual vendors.
üå†Add-on applications should be
installed under either /opt/ or
/opt/ sub-directory.
:one::one:   **/sbin - Essential system binaries**
üå†Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
üå†The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrator, for system maintenance purpose.

:one::two:**/tmp - Temporary Files**
üå†Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
üå†deleted when system is rebooted

:one::three: **/usr - User Utilities**
üå†- Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and
source-code for second level programs.
üå† - /usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If
you can‚Äôt find a user binary under /bin, look under
/usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
üå†- /usr/sbin contains binary files for system
administrators. If you can‚Äôt find a system binary
under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd,
cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
üå†- /usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and
/usr/sbin
üå†/usr/src holds the Linux kernel sources,
header-files and documentation.


## *Text Editors* ‚å®Ô∏è

‚óè Programs That user for text processing.
**‚óè Linux command line text editors**
        ‚óã VIM
        ‚óã Nano
        ‚óã Emacs
        ‚óã Neovim
        ‚óã ‚Ä¶.
**‚óè Linux Graphical Text editors**
    ‚óã Sublime
    ‚óã Vscode
    ‚óã Gedit
    ‚óã Pluma
    ‚óã ‚Ä¶

##ü•á VIM
    ‚óè Before vi the primary editor used on Unix was the line editor
        ‚óã User was able to see/edit only one line of the text at a time
    ‚óè Then then vi editor improved and developed VIM. ( VI iMproved)
    ‚óè The vim editor is:
        ‚óã a very powerful
        ‚óã but at the same time it is cryptic
        ‚óã It is hard to learn, specially for windows users
    ‚óè It have to modes
        ‚óã Command mode -> where you can do commands
        ‚óã Input mode -> where you can write

*VIM Syntax:*
       #Ô∏è‚É£ **vim yourfilename**
>**Vim** is by default on *command mode* when you open it.
‚≠êTo get on insert mode you have to type **‚Äòi‚Äô**
‚≠êTo get back to *command mode* you press ‚Äò**esc**‚Äô 
‚≠êInside Command mode you can:
    *‚óã **Save**: Type **:w + enter**
    ‚óã**quit**: Type **:q + enter**
    ‚óã **Force Quit & Save**: Type **:wq! + enter Force = !**
    ‚óã **Undo**: Type:**undo + enter Or :u**
    ‚óã **Execute bash commands**: Type **:%! yourcommand***   

##ü•àNANO
The **GNU nano** text editor is a user-friendly,free and open source text editor that usually comes pre-installed in modern Linux systems.

Syntax:
**nano filename + enter**
Then start typing

**Saving, Exiting, Undo and Redo**
>Ctrl + S - save
Alt + U - Undo the ^ is equal to ‚ÄòCtrl‚Äô
Alt + E - Redo
Ctrl + X - Exit
Paste,Copy & paste all over the linux is
Ctrl+shift+C - copy
Ctrl+shift+X - Cut
Ctrl+shift+V - Paste 

## *Linux User Management* :computer:
>‚óè On Computer system, person who uses the computer is called **‚Äúuser‚Äù**
‚óè Every Users have Group.
‚óè Users have their own file & applications.
‚óè To know our name on linux -> ‚Äú whoami ‚Äú
‚óè Those users have power/privilege.
‚óè On linux their is 2 kinds users.
    ‚óã Root id = 0
    ‚óã Normal User id= 1-999
The root user have the power to do everything on linux ,
but if users want to have a root access they add sudo in front of the command .
**sudo YourCommand**
**‚óè SUDO = Superuser do , used to pass permission denied**

## *Creating Users* 
‚óè On linux, to create users you can use the following commands
**‚óã Useradd -> simple
    ‚óã Adduser -> Detailed**
‚≠ê Useradd command
    **‚óã sudo useradd username**
‚≠ê Adduser command
    **‚óã sudo adduser username**
>The User files are stored inside /etc/passwd
The User password are stored inside /etc/shadow
When you create a user it creates a group with that name.

‚≠ê**Accessing a user configuration file.**  
  **‚óã cat /etc/passwd**
This commands prints the data of the configuration file. This file contains information about the user in the format.  

**username : x : user id : user group id : : /home/username : /bin/bash**

**‚≠êTo access root user**
Command:    **sudo su**
